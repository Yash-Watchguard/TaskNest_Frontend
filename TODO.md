# TODO for Modifying Delete User Function and Navigation

1. [x] Modify the `deleteuser` function in `admin-dashboard.component.ts` to navigate to 'projecttask' and pass the user in the state after confirmation.
2. Update `user-project-task.component.ts` to extract the user from the navigation state.
